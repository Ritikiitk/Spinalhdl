 Open source , started in december 2014  
 Focus on RTL description
 Thinked to be interoperable with existing tools
 1) It generate VHDL/Verilog files
 2)  It can integrate VHDL/Verilog IP as blackbox (easily).

 
Abstraction level :
1) You can design things similary to VHDL/Verilog.
2) If you want to, you can use many abstraction utils and also
define new ones.  
For me the most thing is that "Spinal HDL" is a RTL language. But the generated VHDL/Verilog
is simulatable with all standards EDA tools.
